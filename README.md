## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about BEM in this project! :rocket: I tried to name all the CSS classes following the BEM precepts, like:

```html

<main class="b-card">

<div class="b-card--img-overlay">

<img src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Equilibrium art" class="b-card__img">

</div>

```

I’m also happy to see myself using CSS Flexbox and Grid in the same interface. I’m improving in my knowledge about how CSS works and having a more logical approach,  feeling less than is something like magic.

I also learned about the need of don’t spend so much time trying to figure out something alone and searching for help. So, after struggling with the best way to show a light blue over the image card when the user hovers, I find and adapt the [codewithshadee solution](https://youtu.be/dyf3aLZ7Dyo).

Now I am eager to do more Frontend Mentor projects.

### Continued development

I discover BEM is an excellent option to organize and name our CSS classes in a clear way. So, I will definitely use it more in the future.

Something I want to improve in future projects is how I can use the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to have more smart implementations for the layouts I am working on.
